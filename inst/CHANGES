version 2.9.5
- Corrected a bug in function hyperGeoTest to avoid significant p-values for 
zero observed hit.
version 2.9.4
- Corrected a contradiction in annotationConvertor. Now it can convert between 
entrez genes and non-entrez genes.
version 2.9.3
- change the dependency of igraph to igraph0 to adapt to the change in BioNet
version 2.9.2
- Gene set overrepresentation and enrichment analysis can run independently 
  using the S4 method 'analyze' by specifying argument 'doGSOA' (for 
  hypergeometric test based overrepresentation analysis) and 'doGSEA' (for 
  GSEA). More details in ?analyze.
- One bug corrected for function 'analyzeGeneSetCollection' when calculating the 
  overlap of significant gene sets in both GSEA and HyperGeo.
version 2.9.1
- moved pakcages BioNet, cellHTS2, AnnotationDbi, biomaRt, RankProd from 
  'depend' to 'import' field in DESCRIPTION
- function 'GOGeneSets' and 'KeggGeneSets', resolved the problem of no global 
  binding for 'org.Hs.egGO2EG', ...
- function 'biogridDataDownload', default download link updated to version 
  3.1.89, tested on Jun 11, 2012
version 2.5.1
- added an attribute 'geneSetSize' to enrichment map in function 'viewEnrichMap' 
  so that the user can rescale the size of gene sets by themselves
- added a new argument 'plot' to function 'viewEnrichMap' so that the user can 
  control whether or not to plot the enrichment map
